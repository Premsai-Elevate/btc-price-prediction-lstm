# btc-price-prediction-lstm
This project is a learning exercise to explore time-series forecasting in the cryptocurrency market. I used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict Bitcoin price trends based on historical data.  Tech Stack Language : Python  Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
# Bitcoin Price Prediction (LSTM Practice)
This is a small project I completed to practice time-series forecasting. I used historical Bitcoin data to see if a basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model could follow market trends.
### What's inside:
- **Data:** ~1,000,000 rows of BTC data resampled to 1-hour intervals.
- **Features:** Used Close price along with RSI, MACD, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Model:** A simple 2-layer LSTM built with TensorFlow/Keras.
### Project Goal:
The main goal was to learn how to:
1. Preprocess large datasets and handle memory efficiently.
2. Build and train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
3. Visualize prediction errors using residual plots.
*Note: This is a learning exercise and not a financial tool.*
